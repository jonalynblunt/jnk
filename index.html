                    I got a glance of Keshaun at work when I was having my interview at our job, and I saw him laughing with someone; I immediately thought he was attractive. As fate would have it, he saw a picture of me through the company e-mail of new hires, and his interest was also piqued. He sent our friend, Traci, to do some scouting. I'd later find that his wit and crazy humor coupled with his dashing good looks would win me over. Keshaun makes me laugh at the most random things, and he just has these clever one-liners in his head ready to go that it's almost admirable, but yet still corny. He's very charming, you know. Always logical, he keeps me grounded. He is thoughtful and supportive; we have been through the fire, and he hasn't given up on us yet. And for that, I am grateful. Keshaun cooks without recipes and knows his way around a house and his manly tools. He loves me wholeheartedly (even at my worst - don't let him tell you otherwise), and he loves our dog, Ripley, with every fiber of his being; he loves my family, and they love him right back. I couldn't imagine being with anyone else to raise a family and spend the rest of my life with.

                    Jonalyn is a very practical person. She is very caring and loves her family. One of the first things she let me know was that her friends had her back and that she had theirs. She gives the best gifts and manages to never be topped (one of these days, perhaps). We met at work, and it was certainly no accident. I did a little investigating to see who the new girl was. I thought she was beautiful when I first saw her -- what an incredible smile, I thought. I had a friend do some question-asking, and the rest is history as the saying goes. We have had our bad times but none have ever made me question my love for her and the desire for her to be my wife.

                    <p>From the start to the end, it was constant moving (or at least it seemed). Before it started, Keshaun and I were both trying to get everything straightened away with the food and set-up. Before anyone came, Keshaun had asked me to wear this turquoise dress that he likes on me. My response: “No. Why?” LOL. But I didn’t say it rudely (at least, I don’t think so). My reasoning (if I remember correctly): I don’t think I had shaved, and putting on that dress would have required me to do that and take more time. And I had no time for that. LOL. At least he tried, haha.</p>

                      I awoke to put together the mammoth of a grill we had just purchased from Home Depot. I was nervous about many things but proposing wasn't one of them. I mean yes I was going to be proposing, but that decision was somehow the most clear decision for me to make that day. My mind was on filling the time with ensuring everything was prepared for the housewarming. In hindsight, I was probably a little nervous about the proposal, but I had to fill my time with busywork, and there was plenty of it.

                    <p>Keshaun pulled me off to the side and said something along the lines of, “Hey, Nick and Verna are leaving. Let’s get everyone together to say thank you.” And I thought that was a good idea. So we pull everyone to the living room, and I’m on the stairs, and my thank yous are unprepared and awkward. “Thanks guys for coming.” LOL. I mean, that was pretty much all I said. </p>

                    <p>Keshaun went after me, and his was a little bit more prepared (obviously), but then he throws the curve ball by saying something along the lines of “But that’s not my only agenda…”</p>

                    After the guests arrived, I then realized the weight of the situation. Nobody but I knew what was going down. I was so nervous I could hardly grill the food. As the party progressed, I recall telling my oldest brother and a few others what was going to happen.

                    <p>So yeah, my hand was shaking, and I was still in shock. I asked people around me (his family) if they knew about it, and of course, no one knew until that day. It was pretty surreal. The euphoria from it is unbelievable.</p>

                    As we gave a toast for all that had come to our housewarming, I mentioned that I had one more thing to address. I got down on one knee and asked the question "Jonalyn, will you marry me?" It took some time for her to realize what was happening, but she eventually said yes. It was a great feeling to have everyone around for the event.

                  <p><i>The historical Rixey Manor was built in 1801 by Charles Rixey and remained in the Rixey family for the next 200 years. The history of the family is amazing, and much of the original house is the same as it was through the Civil War.</i></p>

                  <p><i>The venue will have an open top roof deck with panoramic views of the sunset behind the Blue Ridge mountains and the view from the front of the house overlooks a beautiful lake. Inside the ballroom are nine feet ceilings, chandeliers and floor to ceiling windows.</i></p>

                  <h3>WEATHER</h3>
                  <p>August weather in Rixeyville is typically hot and humid (80s-low 90s). Fortunately, the ceremony will only be outside for a brief time. The reception will be inside, but be sure to bring a sweater or light jacket just in case, as it might get chilly at nighttime.</p>

                  <p>If you have some extra time before and/or after the wedding and you would like to explore the surrounding area, the town of Culpeper is a short drive away from Rixey Manor. You can savor inspired farm-to-fork chef creations, enjoy some very cool shopping, and a show at the restored State Theatre, all in an award-winning historic Downtown.

Down to earth, warm and positive, Rachel does not surround herself with negativity or fakeness, which is why she is as genuine as they come. She has a knack for always being able to spin things in a more positive light any time I have come to her with any of my squabbles with Keshaun. She is fun to be around, and Rachel treats her friends like family; once you're in her circle, know that she will take care of you.

                            Steve is a man of many words. He's a smooth talker but actually believes most of what is coming out of his mouth. Steve and I have grown up together and can reminisce about many stories, but Steve can somehow recall specifics about the most random things. It's always a good time hearing him bring up something I had long forgotten. When Steve isn't busy talking, you can find him manning the bass guitar in his band, Out of the Furnace!

                <p>We would like to express our gratitude for your attendance at our wedding. We know that many of you, coming from both near and far, will make sacrifices in order to be there with us. Your presence and good wishes are the most memorable and thoughtful gift you could give us.</p>

                <p>However, should you find it in your hearts to still give a gift to help us begin this next phase of our journey together, we have started a registry at Bed Bath & Beyond, and we will also create a registry in the near future that will go toward our honeymoon expenses.</p>

                <p>We will keep updating this website once we have all the necessary information for each respective registry. Thank you for your love and support.</p>
