I got a glance of Keshaun at work when I was having my interview at our job, and I saw him laughing with someone; I immediately thought he was attractive. As fate would have it, he saw a picture of me through the company e-mail of new hires, and his interest was also piqued. He sent our friend, Traci, to do some scouting. I'd later find that his wit and crazy humor coupled with his dashing good looks would win me over. Keshaun makes me laugh at the most random things, and he just has these clever one-liners in his head ready to go that it's almost admirable, but yet still corny. He's very charming, you know. Always logical, he keeps me grounded. He is thoughtful and supportive; we have been through the fire, and he hasn't given up on us yet. And for that, I am grateful. Keshaun cooks without recipes and knows his way around a house and his manly tools. He loves me wholeheartedly (even at my worst - don't let him tell you otherwise), and he loves our dog, Ripley, with every fiber of his being; he loves my family, and they love him right back. I couldn't imagine being with anyone else to raise a family and spend the rest of my life with.
