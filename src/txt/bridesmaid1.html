I've known Amber since fresman year of high school when she had just moved to Virginia from California. Amber is one of the funniest people I know, and once you become her friend, you will have loyalty like no other. She has been a constant companion throughout the years and has served as a confidante and sounding board. Caring and considerate, I'm grateful for her friendship.
