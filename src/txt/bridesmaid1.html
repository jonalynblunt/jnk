Steve Cokley
Best Man & Groom's Friend

Steve is a man of many words. He's a smooth talker but actually believes most of what is coming out of his mouth. Steve and I have grown up together and can reminisce about many stories, but Steve can somehow recall specifics about the most random things. It's always a good time hearing him bring up something I had long forgotten. When Steve isn't busy talking, you can find him manning the bass guitar in his band, Out of the Furnace!
