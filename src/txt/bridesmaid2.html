I met Drea in 2009 when she was spending Fourth of July with my brother. We instantly got along and that Fourth of July was one of the most fun nights; I distinctly remember telling my brother, JC, "I like her." What's not to like about Drea? She's one of the sweetest gals I know and never hesitates to lend a hand to help or an ear to listen.
