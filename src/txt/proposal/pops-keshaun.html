As we gave a toast for all that had come to our housewarming, I mentioned that I had one more thing to address. I got down on one knee and asked the question "Jonalyn, will you marry me?" It took some time for her to realize what was happening, but she eventually said yes. It was a great feeling to have everyone around for the event.
