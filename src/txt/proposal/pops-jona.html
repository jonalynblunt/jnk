My first reaction, out loud: “Shut up.” I had absolutely no hunch that it would happen today. I was in such a state of shock that I just didn’t know how to act or what to do.

So yeah, my hand was shaking, and I was still in shock. I asked people around me (his family) if they knew about it, and of course, no one knew until that day. It was pretty surreal. The euphoria from it is unbelievable.
