I awoke to put together the mammoth of a grill we had just purchased from Home Depot. I was nervous about many things but proposing wasn't one of them. I mean yes I was going to be proposing, but that decision was somehow the most clear decision for me to make that day. My mind was on filling the time with ensuring everything was prepared for the housewarming. In hindsight, I was probably a little nervous about the proposal, but I had to fill my time with busywork, and there was plenty of it.
