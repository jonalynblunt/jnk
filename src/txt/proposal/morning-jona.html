From the start to the end, it was constant moving (or at least it seemed). Before it started, Keshaun and I were both trying to get everything straightened away with the food and set-up. Before anyone came, Keshaun had asked me to wear this turquoise dress that he likes on me. My response: “No. Why?” LOL. But I didn’t say it rudely (at least, I don’t think so). My reasoning (if I remember correctly): I don’t think I had shaved, and putting on that dress would have required me to do that and take more time. And I had no time for that. LOL. At least he tried, haha.
