Keshaun pulled me off to the side and said something along the lines of, “Hey, Nick and Verna are leaving. Let’s get everyone together to say thank you.” And I thought that was a good idea. So we pull everyone to the living room, and I’m on the stairs, and my thank yous are unprepared and awkward. “Thanks guys for coming.” LOL. I mean, that was pretty much all I said. 

Keshaun went after me, and his was a little bit more prepared (obviously), but then he throws the curve ball by saying something along the lines of “But that’s not my only agenda…”
