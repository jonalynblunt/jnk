I've known Dominique for so long that I honestly can't remember when or how we met. Let's say I've known her since the second grade; we go way back to eating ice cream while walking on the treadmill and playing hide and seek in our childhood homes (lol). She was my roommate in college, so we have literally grown up together. She's been with me through all my good (and bad) decisions of college, and one of the most supportive and loving friends I could ask for.
