Rachel and I go back to either sixth or seventh grade when we would talk about boys (or rather just her since I was shy, haha). Down to earth, warm and positive, Rachel does not surround herself with negativity or fakeness, which is why she is as genuine as they come. She has a knack for always being able to spin things in a more positive light any time I have come to her with any of my squabbles with Keshaun. She is fun to be around, and Rachel treats her friends like family; once you're in her circle, know that she will take care of you.
